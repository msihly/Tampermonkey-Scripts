# VSCO
### This script is intended to improve the experience of using VSCO by replacing links to image modals with direct links to the source images.

### This script is partially functional due to changes made to VSCO as well as an inconsistent and improper DOM structuring and styling on different pages of the desktop version of the VSCO website.

### The associated stylesheet to be used with the Stylus extension is now hosted at the [Stylus-Stylesheets](https://github.com/msihly/Stylus-Stylesheets) repository on my GitHub.
