# Youtube-DL
### This script adds a way to copy the original URLs of several Youtube videos quickly in a way that is not otherwise available.

### Visit any playlist page on Youtube to have checkboxes added to each video in the playlist and a container that will appear with the original links of the selected videos and copy the links to your clipboard when clicked on. Additionally, visit the page of any individual video to have a 'COPY URL' button appear next to the 'SUBSCRIBE' button. ***NOTICE:** Due to the complex single-page application approach implemented by Youtube, these features will often require the page to be reloaded to function properly.*

### This script is intended for use with the [Youtube-DLG](https://github.com/MrS0m30n3/youtube-dl-gui) application by MrS0m30n3 on GitHub. The required stylesheet for the Stylus extension is hosted at the [Stylus-Stylesheets](https://github.com/msihly/Stylus-Stylesheets) repository on my GitHub.
