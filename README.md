# Tampermonkey Scripts
## *A collection of content scripts to be used with the Tampermonkey extension for Chrome*

### **These scripts are not maintained, optimized, or gauranteed to be fully functional**

Due to the nature of injecting content scripts and stylesheets into websites, these scripts may become, or may already be, partially or entirely non-functional. Scripts that are labeled as *deprecated* in their individual `README.md` files are hosted for posterity and not meant to be deployed.
